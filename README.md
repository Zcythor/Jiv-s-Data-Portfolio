# Jivs-Data-Portfolio
Welcome! Here you can find files related to my portfolios :)
In the Internet Sales Dashboard folder you will find 3 subfolders:
1. Excel Files - Except for FACT_Budget v2 which was provided by the stakeholders, all other DIM and FACT csv files are the queried outputs from using SQL.
2. Power BI - Here you will find the completed dashboard with all models correctly linked in the relational database of models and the corresponding visuals on the main page. Please not that due to the Database not being updated since Jan 2022, filtering for data beyond this will show empty visuals.
3. SQL Queries - These are all the sql scripts I have quieried in SSMS that produce the Excel files.
